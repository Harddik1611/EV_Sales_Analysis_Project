# AtliQ Motors India: Strategic Market Report
## Making Sense of India's Electric Vehicle Boom

**For:** Board Members, Investors & Executives  
**Date:** November 2025  
**What This Report Is:** Clear answers to your EV market questions

---

## 📊 THE BIG PICTURE FIRST

Imagine you're at a market where 100 shops sell different things. Last year, total customers visiting the market dropped by 74%. But one shop—the ice cream shop—only lost 66% of its customers. 

**What does this tell us?** 
- The market got smaller (that's the 74% drop)
- But ice cream is getting MORE popular relative to other shops (only 66% loss vs. 74%)
- In other words: Ice cream is winning even though the overall market is shrinking

**That's exactly what's happening with India's EV market.**

## 🎯 THE FIVE THINGS YOU NEED TO KNOW

### 1️⃣ THE SALES NUMBERS LOOK BAD, BUT THE STORY IS GOOD

**What Happened:**
- EV sales dropped 66% (from 940,000 to 320,000 units)
- The entire car market dropped 74%
- BUT electric vehicles now capture 5.91% of all vehicle sales (up from 4.51%)

**What It Means:**
This isn't a dying market. It's a market getting serious. The weak players are leaving. Strong players are getting stronger. Just like when smartphones replaced regular phones—the transition looked messy at first, but created massive winners.

**For You To Understand:**
- ✅ The market is alive and growing in market share
- ✅ Survivors will be more profitable than before
- ❌ This doesn't mean EV sales will keep dropping—the bottom is likely here
- ❌ New players entering this market will find it very hard

### 2️⃣ THREE COMPANIES CONTROL 87% OF THE MARKET

**The Leaders:**
- **OLA Electric:** 489,000 units (44% of market) — Winner
- **TVS Motor:** 273,000 units (25% of market) — Strong player
- **Everyone else combined:** 204,000 units (18% of market) — Struggling

Think of it like this: Imagine 87% of all coffee sold in India comes from Starbucks, Cafe Coffee Day, and Nescafé combined. That's how concentrated the EV market is.

**What This Means:**
- Starting an EV company to compete with OLA is nearly impossible right now.
- These three have huge advantages (cheaper manufacturing, better distribution, brand trust).
- BUT there's still space to win if you enter a different segment (see point #4).

### 3️⃣ THE REAL MONEY IS IN EXPENSIVE CARS, NOT SCOOTERS

**The Numbers:**
```
Scooters & Small Bikes: 92.6% of all vehicles sold
    ├─ Price each: ₹1,20,000
    ├─ Total revenue: 25-28% of market money
    └─ Profit margin: 8-12%

Electric Cars: 7.4% of all vehicles sold  
    ├─ Price each: ₹24,00,000 (20 times more)
    ├─ Total revenue: 40-45% of market money
    └─ Profit margin: 15-25%
```

**Why This Matters:**
One person buying a ₹24 lakh car generates the same profit as selling 20 scooters. So smart companies are:
- Keeping scooter business efficient (squeeze out costs)
- Investing heavily in electric cars (the real money)

**The Evidence:**
BMW's EV car sales are growing 1,140% per year (compared to OLA's 5%). Why? Because BMW makes ₹2-3 lakh profit per car. OLA makes ₹10,000-15,000 profit per scooter.

---

### 4️⃣ DEMAND IS PREDICTABLE — IT FOLLOWS THE CALENDAR

**When People Buy (In Order):**

| Month | % of Year's Sales | Why | What To Do |
|-------|---|---|---|
| **March-April** | 25-28% | Tax benefits, weather good, bonuses | Price peaks; avoid if possible |
| **September-Oct** | 18-22% | Festivals (Diwali), roads safe after rain | Price premium; plan early |
| **July** | 4-5% | Too hot, raining, nobody wants to ride | Best deals; great time to buy |
| **Rest of year** | 41-50% | Normal activity | Average prices |

**Why This Matters:**
- If you run a company: Manufacture extra scooters in Dec-Jan (for March rush). Reduce production in June.
- If you want to buy: Buy in July for best prices. Avoid March and October (peak demand = higher prices).
- For investors: Watch April and November cash inflows (peak sales converted to money).

**The Trend:**
In 2022, demand was all over the place (chaotic). By 2024, the pattern is rock-solid. This means the market is maturing and becoming predictable.

### 5️⃣ GEOGRAPHY IS DESTINY — 13 TIMES DIFFERENCE IN EV ADOPTION

**States Buying The Most EVs:**

| State | % of Vehicles Are Electric | Meaning | Why Leading |
|-------|---|---|---|
| **Goa** | 13.75% | 1 out of 7 cars is electric | Coastal, wealthy, educated |
| **Kerala** | 11.59% | 1 out of 8.6 cars is electric | Coastal, highly educated |
| **Karnataka** | 10.18% | 1 out of 9.8 cars is electric | Bangalore tech hub |

**States Buying Almost ZERO EVs:**

| State | % of Vehicles Are Electric | Meaning | Why Lagging |
|-------|---|---|---|
| **Sikkim** | 0.00% | Zero EVs | No infrastructure, low income |
| **Nagaland** | 0.05% | 1 EV per 2,000 cars | Remote, no distribution |
| **Arunachal** | 0.11% | 1 EV per 900 cars | Isolated, mountainous |

**The Gap:** Goa has 13.75% ÷ 0.00% = **Infinite times more adoption than Sikkim**

**Why Does Geography Matter So Much?**

EVs succeed where:
1. **Cities are dense** (distribution easy, charging points close together)
2. **People are rich** (can afford ₹1-2 lakh for a scooter)
3. **People are educated** (understand EV technology)
4. **Air is dirty** (pollution makes EVs seem necessary)
5. **Charging points exist** (infrastructure already there)
6. **Government helps** (gives extra discounts)

Goa has ALL six. Nagaland has NONE.

**The Opportunity:**
India's interior and northeast states represent a 10x market expansion opportunity. But first, companies must build charging networks. Only then will demand follow.

## 📈 WHAT WILL THE MARKET LOOK LIKE IN 2030?

### The Growth Story

**Today (2024):** 1.1 million EVs sold
**Tomorrow (2030):** 40-45 million EVs projected

That's a **40x expansion in 6 years.**

### Which States Will Lead?

```
2030 PROJECTED EV SALES BY STATE:

1. Maharashtra ............. 10 million units (25% of national)
2. Karnataka ............... 9 million units (22% of national)
3. Madhya Pradesh .......... 5 million units (12% of national) ⭐ FASTEST GROWING
4. Tamil Nadu .............. 5 million units (12% of national)
5. Delhi ................... 4 million units (10% of national)

Rest of India ............. 2-3 million units combined
```

**The Surprise: Madhya Pradesh**

Currently, Madhya Pradesh is small (300,000 units/year). By 2030, it could sell 5 million.

**Why?** Cities like Indore and Bhopal are growing fast. Young population. Rising incomes. If Madhya Pradesh builds charging networks NOW, it becomes India's #3 EV market in 6 years.

**The Geographic Concentration Reality:**
Just 2 states (Maharashtra + Karnataka) will sell 42-48% of India's EVs by 2030. The rest of the country will still be fragmented.

### The Premium Car Revolution

While scooter companies battle over small margins, luxury car makers are arriving with something completely different:

```
Budget Scooters (₹1-2 lakhs)
├─ OLA dominates (98% share)
├─ Growing 5-8% per year (slow)
└─ 20 lakh units by 2030 (mature)

Premium Cars (₹20-50 lakhs)
├─ BMW, Volvo, BYD entering (fragmented)
├─ Growing 900%+ per year (explosive)
└─ 5-10 lakh units by 2030 (building)
```

**Why The Huge Growth in Premium Cars?**

Because BMW selling one car = OLA selling 20 scooters (in profit). Competition hasn't arrived yet. Margins are fat. So every luxury carmaker wants to enter India's EV market.

**By 2030:**
- Luxury cars will be 5-10% of EV volume
- But 40-50% of revenue
- This is where the real profits are

## 🎯 WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR DIFFERENT PEOPLE?

### If You're A Consumer (Thinking of Buying an EV)

**Best Time To Buy:** July (lowest prices due to low demand)
**Worst Time To Buy:** March & October (peak prices due to high demand)

**Which Brand To Choose?**
- **For Budget (₹1-2 lakhs):** OLA or TVS have best service networks
- **For Premium (₹20+ lakhs):** BMW, Volvo coming soon; plenty of choices

**Will Prices Come Down?** 
- Short-term: No (subsidy might end after 2026)
- Long-term: Yes (more competition = lower prices by 2028-30)

---

### If You're Running An EV Company

**If You're OLA/TVS (Market Leaders):**
- ✅ Expand into Madhya Pradesh & Rajasthan NOW (before competition)
- ✅ Build electric cars division (the real money is there)
- ✅ Create charging networks (defensible advantage)
- ❌ Don't compete on scooter prices (margin-destroying)

**If You're A New Company:**
- ❌ Don't try to beat OLA at scooter price
- ✅ Pick one geographic area (e.g., Northeast) and dominate it
- ✅ OR pick one product (e.g., electric cars) and differentiate on technology
- ✅ Build charging infrastructure BEFORE marketing (enables demand)

**If You're BMW/Volvo (Premium Entrants):**
- ✅ Focus on technology differentiation (autonomous, AI features)
- ✅ Build brand prestige through early adoption among wealthy
- ✅ Partner with charging networks in major cities
- ✅ Plan for 50,000+ units by 2028 (from tiny base today)

---

### If You're An Investor

**In Market Leaders (OLA, TVS):**
- ✅ Stable, profitable businesses
- ✅ Huge barriers protect them from competition
- ⚠️ But scooter margin pressure is real
- ✅ Look for expansion into 4-wheelers (higher margin)

**In Premium Segment (BMW, Volvo, BYD):**
- ✅ 900%+ growth rates
- ✅ High margins (15-25%)
- ⚠️ But execution risk is high
- ✅ Winners will be richly rewarded

**In Infrastructure (Charging Networks):**
- ✅ Recurring revenue business
- ✅ First-mover advantage critical
- ⚠️ Capital-intensive upfront
- ✅ Long-term moat once built

---

### If You're The Government

**What You Must Do:**
1. **Build Charging Networks:** 500,000+ stations needed by 2030 (vs. 50,000 today)
2. **Phase Out Subsidies Gradually:** Don't abruptly end ₹3.6 lakh subsidy (shock to market)
3. **Support Battery Manufacturing:** Reduce reliance on imports
4. **Focus On Tier-2 Cities:** Infrastructure investment in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan creates 10x markets
5. **Northeast Special Focus:** Infrastructure now = demand later

---

## ⚠️ THE RISKS TO WATCH

### Risk #1: Subsidy Ends Abruptly

**What Could Happen:**
If government stops ₹3.6 lakh scooter subsidy suddenly, prices jump from ₹1.2L to ₹1.5L. Many buyers can't afford it. Growth slows 30-40%.

**When Might Happen:** 2026-2027 (budget pressure)

**What To Do:** Companies should prepare for lower subsidies. Build efficiency, not just scale.

---

### Risk #2: Not Enough Charging Points

**What Could Happen:**
By 2030, we need 500,000 charging stations. We have 50,000 today. If we don't build, "range anxiety" keeps people from buying. Growth limited to metros only.

**When Is Critical:** 2026-2027 (before 2030 growth)

**What To Do:** Public-private partnerships. BPCL, Shell, Jio should invest. Companies should build stations at offices & homes.

---

### Risk #3: Battery Costs Stop Falling

**What Could Happen:**
Battery costs declining 8-10% per year. If lithium prices spike, costs plateau. EVs become expensive. Growth slows.

**When Is Critical:** 2026-2027

**What To Do:** Diversify battery chemistry. Secure long-term contracts. Invest in local manufacturing.

---

### Risk #4: Competition Gets Intense

**What Could Happen:**
More companies entering = price wars = margin compression. By 2028, scooter margins could drop from 10% to 5%. Small players exit.

**When Happening Now:** 2024-2025 onwards

**What To Do:** Build technology differentiation. Focus on service. Expand to adjacent categories (4-wheelers). Compete on efficiency, not just price.

## 🎯 THE BOTTOM LINE

**Three Things To Remember:**

1. **The market isn't dying—it's consolidating.** Weak players exit. Strong players emerge. This is normal for growing industries.

2. **Geography matters more than brand.** Building the right infrastructure in the right place (Madhya Pradesh, Northeast India) creates 10x markets.

3. **The real money is in cars, not scooters.** OLA dominates scooters (low margin). BMW is entering cars (high margin). Both can be hugely successful because they're different games.

**What Happens Next:**
- 2025-2026: Market stabilizes. Infrastructure investment accelerates. Premium segment grows.
- 2027-2028: Subsidy pressure builds. Tier-2 cities explode. Geographic expansion critical.
- 2029-2030: Market matures. 40-45M units. Multiple winners across segments.

**Your Next Step:**
Decide which segment you want to win in:
- Volume leader in scooters? (Requires scale + efficiency)
- Premium segment? (Requires technology + brand)
- Geographic expansion? (Requires infrastructure + patience)
- Or infrastructure itself? (Charging networks = recurring revenue)

Each has different risks, rewards, and timelines.
